# DataMiningProject

# Authors: Davide Farinati, Diana Furtado, Hiromi Nakashima

# Context

We were challenged to analyze a dataset provided by the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), consisting of a sample of the results of one of its recent fundraising appeals, in order to develop a customer segmentation to help PVA understand and forecast donors behaviour and perceive potential donation opportunities, producing a marketing report.
This customer segmentation is made by separating the donors into groups (clusters) based on the characteristics they share.
This report intends to go through all the process and reasoning behind the decisions made both on the data cleaning and preprocessing and on the clusters definition and interpretation; ending with the marketing approach recommended for each cluster defined.

# Reproducibility

In order to reproduce the project you can finde in the folder data the zipped version of the dataset used, and in another folder also the the metadata file and the project description. Be sure to also dowload the spec-requirements.txt file or the environment.yml file. Set the paths to import the data of the notebook as the one on your device.
